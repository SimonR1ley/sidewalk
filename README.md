<!-- CONCEPT PROCESS -->
<!-- Briefly explain your concept ideation process -->
<!-- here you will add things like wireframing, data structure planning, anything that shows your process. You need to include images-->

## Concept Process

I started with the design in Figma, I found some inspiration images and combined all the ideas I like and formed my design. From there I started thinking about the functionality the website required and changed the designs around them. I then started the development.

### Wireframes

## Development Process

The `Development Process` is the technical implementations and functionality done for the app.

### Implementation Process

I used <b>React JS</b>, <b>Node JS</b> and <b>Mongo DB</b>.

#### React JS

- I started creating the designs I made in Figma.
- I started making all the nessecery components to link the website together.
- I connected all the components and added the functionality to the website.

#### Node JS

- I created my DB schemas.
- I connected them to my Routes using express and mongoose with the middleware.
- I went back to my components and called my data from the DB as well and linked the components used for pushing the data to the DB

#### Highlights

<!-- stipulated the highlight you experienced with the project -->

- A highlight of this project was definitely learning noSQL.
- I really do see the appeal and will be delving deeper into understanding and mastering more.

#### Challenges

<!-- stipulated the challenges you faced with the project and why you think you faced it or how you think you'll solve it (if not solved) -->

- I encountered quite a bit of challenges:
- I didn't get to add all the functionality I wanted, time got away from me and most of my time was occupied trying to fix bugs and issues for example, I wanted to loop through the indexes of my data call but my for loop wasn't working the the useEffect by the Axios call. I did some research and ended up using a for each loop which helped solve the issue.

### Future Implementation

<!-- TODO Change this! -->

<!-- stipulate functionality and improvements that can be implemented in the future. -->

- I would like to add the images to the website
- I want to fix the orders page where I can remove and update the stock.
- I want to fix my product cards and make them look better and more professional

<!-- MOCKUPS -->

## Final Outcome

### Mockups
