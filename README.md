<!-- GETTING STARTED -->
<!-- Make sure to add appropriate information about what prerequesite technologies the user would need and also the steps to install your project on their own mashines -->
## Getting Started

The following instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

### Prerequisites

Ensure that you have the latest version of [NPM](https://www.npmjs.com/) installed on your machine. The [GitHub Desktop](https://desktop.github.com/) program will also be required.

### How to install

### Installation
Here are a couple of ways to clone this repo:

1. GitHub Desktop </br>
Enter `https://github.com/SimonR1ley/sidewalk.git` into the URL field and press the `Clone` button.

2. Clone Repository </br>
Run the following in the command-line to clone the project:
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/SimonR1ley/sidewalk.git
   ```
    Open `Software` and select `File | Open...` from the menu. Select cloned directory and press `Open` button

3. Install Dependencies </br>
Run the following in the command-line to install all the required dependencies:
   ```
   npm install axios
   <!-- npm install react-calendar -->
   npm install react-router-dom
   ```
## Features and Functionality

<!-- note how you can use your gitHub link. Just make a path to your assets folder -->

### Entering your username

![image2][image2]
Enter your name to start with the quiz. This name can be changed if you would want to.

### Choose a category

![image3][image3]
Select a category of the esports game that you wanted to get tested in, by tapping on the image tiles below.

### Answer Quiz Questions

![image4][image4]
Answer the question given to the user on screen by tapping on the red buttons below and your score will be updated depending if you got the quiz question correct

### Display Score
![image5][image5]
After the user has completed the categories' questions, they can view their score for that category and if they have broken or set a high score they will have a more flared up screen indicating so.

### Show & Reset High Score
![image6][image6]
The user can view their high score as well as reset it in the settings page

<!-- CONCEPT PROCESS -->
<!-- Briefly explain your concept ideation process -->
<!-- here you will add things like wireframing, data structure planning, anything that shows your process. You need to include images-->

## Concept Process

I am a very huge fan of dark theme applications and using colors that contrast extremely well, so in conclusion I thought it was a no-brainer to use in black, white and red in conjunction with each other to create the most eye-catching application. By looking at my wireframes you would notice that my answering method differs from the final application outcome. I have come to realise how intricate and dense Kotlin can be so decided to go with a more simpler, yet effective answering method.

## Development Process

The `Development Process` is the technical implementations and functionality done for the app.

### Implementation Process

I used <b>Kotlin 1.7.0</b> for the functionality and <b>XML</b> for the front-end.

#### XML

- I implemented `ScrollView` for my <b>Settings</b> & <b>Category</b> activities
- `RelativeLayout` was used for my <b>Home</b> activity
- `ConstraintLayout` was used for my <b>Splash</b> activity
- `LinearLayout` was used for majority of the project

#### Kotlin

- I created a `Constants.kt` object file which held all my question variables and my `sharedPreferences` data
- I created a `Questions.kt` class file, where I created the model of my question, meaning what data my question is to consist of like if it has an image, how many answers this question has and I also passed a key/value pair, that will check if my question is correct
- I created a `UpdateUI()` function that will update the question and its answers on one `Questions.kt` activity file instead of creating a different file for each categories' question.
- I used `Intent` to send and receive data from each activity
- I also incorporated `SharedPreferences` to save and send data to each activity, like the users score and username, which will be saved conditionally using an `if()` statement

#### Highlights

<!-- stipulated the highlight you experienced with the project -->

- A highlight of this project was definitely learning a new language (Kotlin) and working and developing for mobile.
- It was also a high point for me to load my app onto my mobile device and interacting with it
- Fixing all of the bugs I struggled with was also a big plus for me

#### Challenges

<!-- stipulated the challenges you faced with the project and why you think you faced it or how you think you'll solve it (if not solved) -->

- I encountered a bug that will not pass the score if the last question of the category is correct, essentially giving the user a 4/5 score instead of a 5/5, unfortunately I could not get this fixed, but will be in later stages of development of XP
- It was very challenging sending and receiving data using `SharedPreferences` but got it figured out in the end
- I was flabbergasted at how dense Kotlin actually is, so wrapping my head around how the code is written and how data works was a struggle to say the least

### Future Implementation

<!-- TODO Change this! -->

<!-- stipulate functionality and improvements that can be implemented in the future. -->

- I would like to add more questions
- I want to change the answering method, making it more intricate and fun
- I want to implement Firebase or Firestore
- I want to fix my Shared Preferences bug
- I want to add more games that are part of the esports world
